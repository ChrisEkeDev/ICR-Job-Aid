            </p>
            <p>
                As an Inside Commercial Representative, you are the frontline connection between customers and WM.

            <h2>Getting Started</h1>
            <p>
                The first step every day will require you to access our <span class="accent">Virtual Desktop Interface (VDI)</span>, where all of your job duties will be performed. You should have already received your employee email and created your password to access the WM systems. This same login will be used to access VDI.
            </p>
            <div class="tip-wrapper">
                <span class="tip-icon accent-gold">
                    <i class="fa-solid fa-lightbulb"></i>
                </span>
                <p class="tip-body">
                    If you don't have your login credentials, please reach out to your direct supervisor.
                </p>
            </div>
            <h3>Accessing VDI</h2>
            <p>
                Once you turn on your company-issued computer and access the desktop, the login page for VDI should pop up automatically. If it does not, click on the green computer icon (pictured below) to open a browser and navigate to the login page.
            </p>
            <img class="app-icon" src="/assets/vmware.png">
            <p>
                Once on this page, you will use your company-issued login credentials to enter the <span class="accent">VDI</span> system. After logging in, you will need to select the correct VDI interface. Reach out to your supervisor to confirm which one to select. You will then be prompted to enter your password again. Once completed, you will have successfully accessed the virtual desktop.
            </p>
            <div class="tip-wrapper">
                <span class="tip-icon accent-gold">

                <p class="tip-body">
                    You may experience issues accessing the virtual environment on occasion. If an error occurs, it's important to try again a few times to see if the issue resolves itself. If you continue to receive errors, reach out to your supervisor for assistance.

            <h2>Everyday Apps</h2>
            <p>
                Once you've accessed the <span class="accent">VDI</span>, take some time to familiarize yourself with the apps you will be using daily. These apps help support your daily responsibilities, streamline communication between departments and colleagues, and, most importantly, provide you with the resources to perform your job efficiently and effectively. The most important apps and programs you will use are listed below:
            </p>
            <div class="tip-wrapper">
                <span class="tip-icon accent-gold">
                    <i class="fa-solid fa-lightbulb"></i>
                </span>
                <p class="tip-body">
                    When accessing some of these apps for the first time of the day, you may be required to authenticate yourself the same way you did initially. You will use the same credentials provided to you on all occasions, unless otherwise specified.
                </p>
            </div>
            <h3>KRONOS</h3>
            <p>
                <span class="accent">KRONOS</span> is our timekeeping application for tracking your work hours. It's important to know how to access this app to ensure you are paid for the hours you work. The icon to access <span class="accent">KRONOS</span> is pictured below.
            </p>
            <img class="app-icon" src="/assets/kronos.png">
            <p>You will access <span class="accent">KRONOS</span> at least four times a day:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>At the start of your shift to clock in</li>
                <li>When you clock out for your lunch break</li>
                <li>When you clock back in from your lunch break</li>
                <li>When you clock out at the end of the day</li>
            </ul>
            <div class="tip-wrapper">
                <span class="tip-icon accent-gold">
                    <i class="fa-solid fa-lightbulb"></i>
                </span>
                <p class="tip-body">
                    KRONOS is also used to request time off and view your accrued Holiday, Vacation, and Personal hours for time off requests.
                </p>
            </div>
            <h3>Avaya Agent</h3>
            <p>
                <span class="accent">Avaya Agent</span> is the program we use to make and receive phone calls with customers. You'll need to access this program immediately after clocking in to ensure your phone system functions properly. The icon for this program is pictured below.
            </p>
            <img class="app-icon" src="/assets/avaya.png">
            <p>
                You'll need to log in to the <span class="accent">Avaya Agent</span> app in the Station section using your Station ID and a password. Your Station ID is essentially your phone number in the VDI system; however, you should not share it with anyone. You will also be given a password, which is the same for all agents.
            </p>
            <div class="tip-wrapper">
                <span class="tip-icon accent-gold">
                    <i class="fa-solid fa-lightbulb"></i>
                </span>
                <p class="tip-body">
                    If it's your first time accessing the Avaya Agent program on your computer, you will need to configure the settings. Reach out to your supervisor if you are unsure how to proceed or if you are prompted for additional information.
                </p>
            </div>
            <h3>NICE</h3>
            <p><span class="accent">NICE</span> is another app we use to manage our daily schedules. While <span class="accent">KRONOS</span> focuses on the overarching schedule, <span class="accent">NICE</span> provides more specific details about your daily tasks. <span class="accent">NICE</span> is accessed through the Google Chrome browser, and your supervisor should have given you the URL to log in. <span class="accent">NICE</span> is used for the following purposes:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Viewing your scheduled meetings</li>
                <li>Checking your breaks and lunch times</li>
                <li>Viewing your scheduled coaching sessions</li>
                <li>Monitoring your call statistics, including average handle time and the number of calls taken</li>
                <li>Reporting any downtime outside of your regular schedule, such as internet outages and system issues</li>
            </ul>
            <div class="tip-wrapper">
                <span class="tip-icon accent-gold">
                    <i class="fa-solid fa-lightbulb"></i>
                </span>
                <p class="tip-body">
                    NICE is updated regularly. While most days your schedule may remain the same, it's important to check it frequently for updates to ensure you remain in adherence.
                </p>
            </div>
            <h3>Microsoft Teams</h3>
            <p>
                <span class="accent">Microsoft Teams</span> is the collaboration tool we use to quickly communicate with colleagues. It is used for team meetings and provides excellent video, voice, and text communication capabilities. The icon to access Microsoft Teams is pictured below.
            </p>
            <img class="app-icon" src="/assets/teams.png">
            <p>
                It's important to remain attentive to <span class="accent">Teams</span>, as it allows supervisors and leads to quickly distribute important information about service area updates, system issues, and even morale-boosting messages.
            </p>
            <h3>Microsoft Outlook</h3>
            <p>
                <span class="accent">Microsoft Outlook</span> is used to manage our email communications. It's important to check your emails throughout the day for updates regarding service and market area notices, changes to assigned cases, company-wide bulletins, customer requests, and more. The icon for Microsoft Outlook is pictured below:
            </p>
            <img class="app-icon" src="/assets/outlook.png">
            <h3>Visor</h3>
            <p>
                <span class="accent">Visor</span> is our company-wide employee portal. It houses everything you need related to WM, including various company resources, access to HR tools, and company news and updates.
            </p>
            <p>
                We will use Visor to access several important programs needed to perform your job successfully. Below are the steps to access the list of WM applications.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Open your browser, such as <span class="accent">Google Chrome</span> or <span class="accent">Microsoft Edge</span></li>

                <li>Browse or search the list to find the applications listed below</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Employee Console (Salesforce)</h3>
            <p>
                <span class="accent">Employee Console</span> is a recent and essential addition to your work resources. It serves as our primary Customer Relationship Management (CRM) tool, housing all customer accounts and enabling us to perform most, if not all, of our daily job duties. We will cover your daily job responsibilities and expectations later in this guide.
            </p>
            <h3>DRIVE</h3>
            <p>
                <span class="accent">DRIVE</span> stands for Deliver Results, Increase Value, and Engagement. It is an extension of the <span class="accent">NICE</span> application mentioned earlier and serves as our internal hub for managing agent success.
            </p>
            <p>
                <span class="accent">DRIVE</span> keeps a detailed record of your call statistics, including Quality, Average Handle Time, and PCS survey scores. It is also where you will document and acknowledge all of your scheduled coaching sessions with your supervisors.
            </p>
            <p>
                <span class="accent">DRIVE</span> is essential for all employees, as it allows you to stay up to date on your performance trends and identify areas for improvement. Be sure to check DRIVE regularly and be prepared to discuss your progress with your supervisor during coaching sessions.

            <h2>Daily Responsibilities</h2>
            <p>
                Now that we have reviewed the apps you will use on a day-to-day basis, letâ€™s explore how you will use them. For the most part, your responsibilities will include answering customer inquiries via phone calls and emails, attending team meetings, and participating in one-on-one coaching sessions. We will provide further details on these below.
            </p>
            <h3>Phone Calls & Emails</h3>
            <p>
                ICR agents are primarily responsible for handling incoming phone calls and email requests from customers. You will receive a wide array of requests from these phone calls and emails, and while this job aid is not intended to serve as a comprehensive guide on handling every type of call or email, we will cover the most common types of calls and emails you will receive.

            <h3>Team Meetings</h3>
            <p>
                Periodically, you will be scheduled to attend team meetings with agents in your market area as well as area team leads. These meetings serve as a way to check in on a more personal level with all agents and provide useful information, such as market area updates, company-wide changes, recent trends that need to be addressed, and other important updates.
            </p>
            <p>
                Usually, after the meetings, you will have an opportunity to ask questions about the discussion or anything you may be unsure about. <span class="accent">Be sure to take advantage of this time, as it is dedicated solely to addressing your inquiries.</span>
            </p>
            <h3>Coaching Sessions</h3>
            <p>
                Twice a month, you will be required to attend coaching sessions with your supervisor. These one-on-one meetings will review your performance indicators for the current period and identify opportunities for improvement.
            </p>
            <p>
                You will use <span class="accent">DRIVE</span> to conduct the coaching session, so be sure to check it before your scheduled session to prepare and note any topics you'd like to discuss. <span class="accent">This time is dedicated solely to you, so take advantage of the opportunity to develop improvement plans and ask your supervisor for any assistance you may need.</span>
            </p>
            <p>
                At the end of each session, your supervisor will document the results in <span class="accent">DRIVE</span>, acknowledging everything discussed and outlining any action plans based on the conversation.
            </p>

                Success as an <span class="accent">Inside Commercial Representative</span> begins with understanding what constitutes success. Itâ€™s not about knowing every answer immediately, but rather understanding where to find the answers and how to relay that information in a way that drives customer satisfaction.

                Understanding your key performance indicators and the resources available to you is a vital part of your role and will help ensure your success at WM.

            <p>
                Your <span class="accent">Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)</span> help supervisors assess your efficiency in handling calls. They provide insight into your performance, highlight areas for improvement, and determine whether you meet the company's success standards.

                        <h4>Quality</h4>
                        <p>
                            Quality refers to the overall effectiveness of your calls. Your supervisors will review a set number of calls each month and score them based on specific criteria. Your grade depends on meeting key elements of the call, including a professional greeting, demonstrating empathy, achieving first-call resolution, respecting the customerâ€™s time, and properly closing the call.

                    <div>
                        <h4>Average Handle Time</h4>
                        <p>
                            Average Handle Time refers to the average amount of time you spend on the phone with a customer. While delivering excellent service and addressing all concerns is essential, it is equally important to respect the customer's time and resolve issues efficiently.

                    <div>
                        <h4>Adherence</h4>
                        <p>
                            Adherence measures how accurately you follow your schedule. This includes clocking in and out on time, taking and returning from lunch breaks as scheduled, and being in the correct status. Schedules are designed to ensure agents are available to handle the workload, so it is essential to be where you are supposed to be, when you are supposed to be there.

                        <h4>After Call Waiting</h4>
                        <p>
                            After Call Waiting (ACW) refers to the average time you take to document and categorize calls after they end. After each call, you are required to leave notes and select the appropriate call category from the menu. If your ACW time is too high, it indicates that you are spending excessive time off the phones, which can impact overall efficiency.

                        <p>
                            Post Call Survey (PCS) scores are surveys randomly given to customers after their call with you. They provide insight into the customerâ€™s experience beyond other KPIs, measuring how the customer felt about you, how well you handled the call, and their confidence that their issue will be resolved.

            <h3>Where to Find Help</h3>
            <p>
                As mentioned earlier, more important than knowing every answer right off the bat, it's crucial to know where to find the answers efficiently. You have a wealth of resources available to ensure you can perform your job comfortably, and it's essential that you utilize them.

                    <h4>Knowledge</h4>
                    <p>
                        Knowledge is a database built into Employee Console and should be your first stop for any questions you may have. It provides comprehensive and detailed information on all issues across every market area. Topics are searchable by line of business, market area, or resource type. If you find any missing or inaccurate information, you can submit a ticket to request an update.

                    <h4>Fellow Agents</h4>
                    <p>
                        If you aren't able to find your answer in Knowledge, you can also reach out to your fellow agents. Some of your colleagues have likely handled similar calls and may be able to answer your question or provide information quickly. However, be mindful that they are also taking calls and may not always be able to respond immediately.

                    <h4>Team Leads & Supervisors</h4>
                    <p>
                        If all else fails, consider reaching out to your supervisor. Supervisors possess a wealth of knowledge and, like other agents, have likely encountered various situations, including more complex or niche issues. However, keep in mind that supervisors and team leads have their own workloads. Be sure to utilize all available resources to ensure efficiency and effectiveness in your role.

            <h3>Tips for Success</h3>
            <p>
                At WM, we want you to succeed. After providing you with the necessary tools and resources, here are some valuable tips from experienced agents to further support your success.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Develop a call flow that aligns with all quality standards. Once you establish a rhythm that works, stick to it. Maintaining consistency will help you achieve consistently high-quality scores.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Use a note-taking app that you're comfortable with. Keep essential notes handy, such as frequently used phone numbers, email addresses, templates, and key talking points to improve efficiency.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Don't take it personally. You will likely encounter upset customers who may vent their frustrations to you. While you may not be directly responsible for the issue, you represent the company. Stay professional and remember that itâ€™s never personal.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Save bookmarks for quick access during calls. Organizing frequently visited resources will help you quickly retrieve important information, improving your average handle time and overall performance scores.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                In the early stages, focus on familiarizing yourself with the programs, processes, and available resources. As you gain experience, you will develop your own workflow and become more confident in handling calls with ease.
